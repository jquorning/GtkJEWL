  Revision 1.4  2001/01/25 09:00:00  je
  Changes visible to the user:

  * Added support for drawing bitmaps on canvases (Draw_Image operations
    and new type Image_Type)
  * Added Play_Sound
  * Added several new operations on all windows: Get_Origin, Get_Width,
    Get_Height, Set_Origin, Set_Size and Focus
  * Added several functions giving screen and window dimensions: Screen_Width,
    Screen_Height, Frame_Width, Frame_Height, Dialog_Width, Dialog_Height and
    Menu_Height
  * Canvases can now handle keyboard events: new constructor and Key_Code added
  * Added procedure Play_Sound
  * Operations "+" and "-" added for Point_Type
  * Pens can now be zero pixels wide
  * The absolute origin of a frame can now have be specified when the frame
    is created
  * Added new File_Dialog operations Add_Filter and Set_Directory
  * Added Get_Line renames to JEWL.IO for compatibility with Ada.Text_IO
  * Added all the Get(File,Item) operations mentioned in documentation but
    unaccountably missing :-(
  * Documentation updated to reflect the above changes
  * HTML versions of public package specifications added with links from
    main documentation pages

  Other internal changes:

  * Canvas fonts, pens etc. now use JEWL.Reference_Counted_Type rather than
    reinventing this particular wheel, as do images
  * Various minor code formatting changes: some code reordered for clarity,
    some comments added or amended,
  * Changes introduced in 1.2 to support GNAT 3.10 have been reversed, since
    GNAT 3.10 still couldn't compile this code correctly... ;-(

  Outstanding issues:

  * Optimisation breaks the code (workaround: don't optimise)
